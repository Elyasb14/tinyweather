* TINYWEATHER

Tinyweather is a weather station designed to be small, robust, and easy to use. This repo contains all the code used in the project. We plan on supporting a wide variety of sensors and telemetry options.

* SUPPORTED SENSORS

- RG-15 Rain gauge: https://rainsensors.com/products/rg-15/

* SUPPORTED TELEMETRY OPTIONS

- TCP/IP (see src/lib/tcp.zig and src/lib/handlers.zig)
  - with Prometheus (https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) for long term storage

* USAGE

To start, you need to spin up a node. Tinyweather stations run the node software (node.zig). The node is responsible for relaying sensor data back to the client that requested it. To run a node, use the following command: 

```bash
zig build run-node
```

This will start a tcp server listening on the port you pass it.

Then, you need to set up a proxy. The proxys job is to take in requests for sensor data, ask a node for that sensor data, and then reply to the request for data with the data it received. To start a proxy, run the following:

```bash
zig build run-proxy
```

Currently, you can make an http request to the proxy at the endpoint /metrics and you will get a prometheus readable string of sensor data back. You define what sensor data you want with http headers, the following example gets RainTotalAcc: 

```bash
curl localhost:8081/metrics -H "sensor:RainTotalAcc"  
```
