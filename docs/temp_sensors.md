# Temp Sensors

We have a problem. I hate how we have to go to python and download a ton of libs to get temperature. We need to explore other options. I bought (this)[https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SKU_SEN0546_I2C_Temperature_and_Humidity_Sensor_Stainless_Steel_Shell], it seems to be pretty simple. I've found some (python sample code)[https://www.dfrobot.com/forum/topic/335192?srsltid=AfmBOopzBqwovoCCgz2HSF9Vry_XfEjiD5f3uFfIwgdyoAB5dEG5SYzX] that seems pretty simple. I'd like to write it in zig, but c would be fine.
